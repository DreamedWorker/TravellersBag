TravellersBag is a tool set app designed for modern macOS, open source based on GPLv3.0 protocol, and designed to improve Mac users' Genshin Impact out of game experience. It provides relatively complete functionality through the official access interface, and for all your data, this tool-set only provides read-only functionality to fully ensure data security during use.

## Installation
You can compile and use it from our source code. Of course, you can also download the `.zip` file that we have compiled based on the latest version from the "release" tab of this repo, and move the app to the `/Applications` folder after unpacking, and then you can start it.

It should be noted that if you download the application directly to install it, you will need to go to the `system settings` to allow this software to run after opening the application.

## Goal
Currently, the community has produced quite a lot of excellent results in terms of Genshin Impact toolbox app, but most of them are aimed at the Windows platform. 
And Apple is gradually making an effort in gaming to create a gaming ecosystem on the Mac platform, and at the same time, Genshin Impact can also run perfectly on the Mac through the translation layer of wine and so on. 
In addition, there is still a need to develop relatively complete toolbox app for the Mac platform (for Windows), so we hope to use this repository as an introduction to provide a convenient toolset for travelers using Macs.

## Reference
In the development process, we drew on many excellent achievements and cases in the current community, which are of great significance to the completion of this software.
- `Snap Hutao`(Excellent GI toolset app for Windows): The user-selectable downloads on the bootstrap page during the first cold start of the app come from the efforts of `DGP Studio`.
- `Enka.Network`(Website): In case we can't locate the required image resources locally, we cache some of the images from this website through the KFImage component.

The use of static resources in this app if there is an infringement of your rights, please promptly raised in the repository, I will be the first time to remove the resources involved and the relevant Releases.

## Contribution
I am not a professional developer, and my major has almost nothing to do with computers. I developed this app out of programming interest and love for the game.

I welcome you to join the development process, and please join the Discord server to communicate together.

## Acknowledgement
This app could not have been created without Mihoyo's excellent work, Genshin Impact, and its inclusive approach to community content creation, and we look forward to further future.

Also the completion of this application is inseparable from the support of other open source software:
