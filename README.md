## Installation
You can install (or update) this software to the disk in the following two ways:

- Download the file ending with ".dmg" on the [Release](https://github.com/DreamedWorker/TravellersBag/releases) page of this repository, double-click to open it and drag the software into the `/Applications` alias;
- After cloning the source code of this repository, open it in Xcode, compile and install it by yourself. ( <b>Note: You should always clone the source code of the "main" branch to ensure that it can be compiled and functionally complete.</b>)

## Goal
Currently, the community has produced quite a lot of excellent results in terms of Genshin Impact toolbox app, but most of them are aimed at the Windows platform.
And Apple is gradually making an effort in gaming to create a gaming ecosystem on the Mac platform, and at the same time, Genshin Impact can also run perfectly on the Mac through the translation layer of wine and so on.
In addition, there is still a need to develop relatively complete toolbox app for the Mac platform (for Windows), so we hope to use this repository as an introduction to provide a convenient toolset for travelers using Macs.

## Reference
In the development process, we drew on many excellent achievements and cases in the current community, which are of great significance to the completion of this software.
- `Snap Hutao`(Excellent GI toolset app for Windows): The user-selectable downloads on the bootstrap page during the first cold start of the app come from the efforts of `DGP Studio`.

The use of static resources in this app if there is an infringement of your rights, please promptly raised in the repository, I will be the first time to remove the resources involved and the relevant Releases.

## Contribution
I AM NOT a professional developer, and my major has almost nothing to do with computers. I developed this app out of programming interest and love for the game. And I welcome you to join the development process.

## Acknowledgement
This app could not have been created without Mihoyo's excellent work, Genshin Impact, and its inclusive approach to community content creation, and we look forward to further future.
